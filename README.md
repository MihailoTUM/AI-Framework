This Tensor library should be a fundamental one. It direcly interacts with CUDA to harness a GPU's computational capabilities.


## Tensor 
A Tensor is a simply said an array stored in C++. All functions are basically operations that change the array of the Tensor.

### 
### addition
### multiplication (scalar)
### multiplication (matrix-matrix)
### aggreagation sum and mean
